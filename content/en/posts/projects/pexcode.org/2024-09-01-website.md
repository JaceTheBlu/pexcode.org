- **Community Hub**: Access information about our projects, latest updates, and ways to get involved.
- **Clean Design**: Enjoy a modern, responsive layout that looks great on any device.

### Built with Hugo 🚀

We chose Hugo for its speed and flexibility, allowing us to create a website that’s both fast and easy to maintain. This project provided us with valuable experience in:

- **Static Site Generation**: Harnessing Hugo’s powerful features to build a static site with exceptional performance.
- **Web Development**: Applying modern web development practices, including responsive design and user experience optimization.
- **Content Management**: Learning to manage and structure content efficiently using Hugo’s markdown-based approach.

This project has been a fantastic opportunity to apply and enhance our skills in web development, and we’re excited to continue leveraging these technologies to support our community.
