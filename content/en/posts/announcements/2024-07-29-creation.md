## The Beginning of Something Great ðŸš€

On **July 29, 2024**, a friend and I embarked on a journey to support young developers in shaping their skills, providing real-world experience, and creating a collaborative environment for growth. As fresh graduates ourselves, we understood the struggles of finding that crucial first professional experience.

We created this legal umbrella under the **French 1901 association** model to give structure to our idea. The goal? To provide young developers like us with the opportunity to work on multiple projects in a setting that mirrors a business environmentâ€”giving them practical experience and a supportive community.

### Why We Did It ðŸ’¡

The idea stemmed from our own experiences: graduating with strong technical skills but facing challenges breaking into the industry without that critical first experience. We wanted to bridge that gap for others, helping them develop their skills while collaborating on projects that matter.

PexCode.org is designed to be a place where passion meets opportunity, where developers can grow, learn, and gain hands-on experience that will give them a real edge in their careers.
